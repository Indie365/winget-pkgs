# Authoring a Manifest

The minimal manifest syntax is below.

Current limitations are:
* One manifest per PR
* One installer per PR

Be sure the manifest filename matches the `Version` and the manifest is located in the folder path matching `manifests\<publisher>\<package>\<version>.yaml`

```yaml
Id: string # publisher.package format
Publisher: string # the name of the publisher
Name: string # the name of the application
Version: string # version numbering format
License: string # the open source license or copyright
InstallerType: string # enumeration of supported installer types (exe, msi, msix)
Installers:
  - Arch: string # enumeration of supported architectures
    URL: string # path to download installation file
    Sha256: string # SHA256 calculated from installer
# ManifestVersion: 0.1.0
```
