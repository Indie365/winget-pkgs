ReleaseNotes: |
 First stable release of v7, using the HandBrake 1.5.1 core. This is a smaller major version update as HandBrake has put out a smaller stable version release.
 * Changed to use .NET 6.0. The installer should automatically install this, and the portable version should have all necessary files embedded and not need the install.
 * Switched to Squirrel installer package.
  - Install is now 1-click and auto-launches without an install wizard.
  - Auto-updates no longer require a UAC prompt.
  - Auto-updates now happen silently on next program launch. There is an optional setting to be notified of new versions on startup.
  - A single click can restart VidCoder with the new version, similar to Chrome or Edge.
 * Added zip of binary files to GitHub releases, for those who want to install a specific version of VidCoder or customize their install.
 * Added the option to immediately recycle or delete source files after a successful encode.
 * Moved source recycle/delete options from Global Options to the Picker window under the Post-encoding section.
 * Added ability to constrain cropping to a single axis (whatever is cropped the most).
 * Added ability to set a minimum cropping threshold, to prevent small changes to the picture size.
 * Changed cropping type selection from radio buttons to a dropdown box.
 * If immediate source file removal is enabled in the Picker, (Encoded) will no longer be appended when the source path is the same as the destination path. This means that you can set it up to re-encode a file in place instead of creating a copy elsewhere.
 * Updated to determine if an encoder supports two-pass by calling into the HandBrake core.
 * Removed pastebin functionality for logs, and replaced with a menu option to report a problem with an completed encode.
 * Added option in help menu to request a feature.
 * Updated "report bug" menu item to auto-fill the VidCoder version and install type.
 * Added tooltip for Chroma Smooth filter.
 * Fixed video encoding Tune value not updating correctly when switching encoding presets with different containers.
 * Added app manifest to declare us as per monitor DPI aware, which fixes window maximization in some multi-monitor setups with different DPIs.
 * Changed beta info update check to happen only when switching to the update tab in options.
 * Only show the "duplicate" button when an audio/subtitle track is already selected. This should make it less likely that it's mistaken for the button to enable the track.
 * Changed handbrake temp file cleanup to not use regular expressions. This should stop a mysterious intermittent issue caused by not being able to find System.Text.RegularExpressions.dll.
 * Fixed issue that caused a delay in cleaning up old HandBrake temp files on exit.
 * Changed beta info update check to happen only when switching to the update tab in options.
 * Added fallback logic to pick a valid audio encoder when the one in the encoding profile is not available.
 * Fixed issue with out-of-order initialization that caused a crash on startup while upgrading presets.
