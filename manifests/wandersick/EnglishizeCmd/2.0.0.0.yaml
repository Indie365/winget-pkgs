Description: There often comes a need to use built-in command-line tools in English in non-English Windows, as they are localized to another language which can be difficult for admins who only speak English. Englishize Cmd conveniently englishizes Windows command-line interface with 'englishize.bat' command and restores to the original language with 'restore.bat' command.
