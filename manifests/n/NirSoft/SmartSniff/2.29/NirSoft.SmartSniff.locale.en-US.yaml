ShortDescription: Capture TCP/IP packets on your network adapter
Description: >
  SmartSniff is a network monitoring utility that allows you to capture TCP/IP packets that pass
  through your network adapter, and view the captured data as sequence of conversations between
  clients and servers. You can view the TCP/IP conversations in Ascii mode (for text-based
  protocols, like HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and FTP) or as hex dump (for non-text base protocols, like
  DNS).
