ShortDescription: A command-line installer for Windows.
Description: |
  Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:

  - Eliminates permission popup windows
  - Hides GUI wizard-style installers
  - Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs
  - Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
  - Finds and installs dependencies automatically
  - Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program

  Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:

  ```powershell
  scoop install sudo
  sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global
  scoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch
  scoop install python ruby go perl
  ```

  If you've built software that you'd like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer (e.g. MSI or InnoSetup) â€” you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.
