ShortDescription: West Wind WebSurge - URL and Web Load Testing made easy
Description: "West Wind WebSurge is an easy to use Web URL and load testing tool that makes it easy to capture or enter a series of Web requests, and test them interactively or under automated heavy load. The goal is to make the process of creating, managing and playing back of HTTP requests easy, so you can test and re-test your sites frequently and catch performance or application issues early in the development cycle.\nUse our built-in Web capture tool to capture and filter Web sessions from Web Browsers or Windows applications, use Telerik's Fiddler or manually create sessions using plain text HTTP headers in a text file. All HTTP request data is stored as plain HTTP headers, so it's easy to create, edit or generate test sessions manually of via code.\nCapture HTML requests, AJAX, REST and SOAP services. Capture SSL requests, provide POST data and custom headers - anything HTTP supports you can use in your session. Once captured play back the session under load by running for a specified time and number of simultaneous sessions. See summarized results, a few simple  graphs and examine individual requests and failures. Finally a command line tool is available to automate load tests from the command prompt or with shell scripts."
